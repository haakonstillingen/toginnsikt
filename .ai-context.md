# AI Agent Context - Toginnsikt Project

## 🎯 Project Overview
This is a production train delay analytics system with strict security and workflow requirements.

## 🔒 Security Context
- **Database credentials** are stored in Google Cloud Secret Manager
- **NEVER hardcode secrets** - always use `config_cloud.py` patterns
- **All sensitive data** must go through Secret Manager
- **Security scans** are enforced and must pass

## 🚀 Workflow Context
- **Branch Protection**: Direct pushes to `main` are blocked
- **PR Required**: All changes must go through Pull Requests
- **Validation Required**: All workflows must pass before merging
- **Issue References**: Always reference GitHub issues in commits

## 📁 Critical Files
- `.cursorrules` - **Primary AI instructions**
- `config_cloud.py` - Secret management patterns
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD validation
- `.github/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` - Complete workflow guide

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Hardcoding credentials** - use Secret Manager
2. **Direct pushes to main** - use feature branches
3. **Bypassing security checks** - fix issues instead
4. **Missing issue references** - always link to GitHub issues
5. **Ignoring workflow failures** - fix before merging

## 🎯 When Working on This Project
1. **Read `.cursorrules` first**
2. **Check existing issues** before creating new work
3. **Create feature branch** from main
4. **Follow security patterns** in `config_cloud.py`
5. **Test thoroughly** before creating PR
6. **Reference issues** in all commits and PRs
7. **Wait for all checks** to pass before merging

## 🔍 Current Status
- ✅ Security hardened with Secret Manager
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline fully configured
- ✅ Branch protection active
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation available
- ✅ Ready for production use

**Remember**: This is a production system handling real data. Follow all security and workflow requirements strictly.
