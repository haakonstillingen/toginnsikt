## 🐛 CRITICAL BUGS - DATA QUALITY ISSUES

### **CRITICAL PRIORITY - Fix Immediately**

#### **BUG #1: Systematic Delay Calculation Errors** ��
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Bug fix deployed and working correctly  
**Issue:** Records showing positive `delay_minutes` values despite missing `actual_departure_time`

**Resolution:**
- ✅ **Root cause identified** - Lines 577-578 in `enhanced_commute_collector_cloud.py`
- ✅ **Fix implemented** - Removed calculation from expected_departure_time
- ✅ **Data validation added** - Prevents future inconsistent data
- ✅ **Deploy

#### **BUG #2: Sub-minute Delay Rounding Issues** ⚠️
**Status:** HIGH - Affects accuracy of delay statistics  
**Issue:** Delays under 1 minute are rounded to 0, losing precision

**Examples:**
- `06:21:00` planned → `06:21:42` actual = 42 seconds (marked as 0 delay)
- `08:51:00` planned → `08:51:45` actual = 45 seconds (marked as 0 delay)

**Impact:** Underreports actual delay frequency and patterns  
**Fix Required:** Define consistent rounding policy (round to nearest minute vs preserve seconds)

#### **BUG #3: Missing Cancellation Detection** ✅ COMPLETED
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - 3-tier classification system fully implemented and working  
**Issue:** ~~System doesn't properly detect or handle train cancellations for business statistics~~

**Resolution Summary:**
- ✅ **3-tier classification system implemented** with 5 departure statuses
- ✅ **Intelligent cancellation detection** using expected_departure_time analysis
- ✅ **Business intelligence fields** added to database schema (Migration 003)
- ✅ **Classification logic working** with 100% test success rate
- ✅ **Production integration complete** - classification happens during data collection

**Implemented Features:**
1. ✅ **Departure Status Classification:** on_time, delayed, cancelled, severely_delayed, unknown
2. ✅ **Smart Cancellation Detection:** Uses expected time vs planned time analysis
3. ✅ **Business Metrics Calculation:** On-time rate, delay rate, cancellation rate, severe delay rate
4. ✅ **Database Schema Enhanced:** departure_status, classification_reason, expected_delay_minutes fields
5. ✅ **Production Ready:** Active classification during data collection with comprehensive logging

**Test Results:**
- ✅ **7/7 classification scenarios passed** (100% success rate)
- ✅ **Business metrics calculation verified** with accurate percentage calculations
- ✅ **Edge cases handled** including boundary conditions (2min, 3min, 15min, 16min delays)
- ✅ **Production Integration Confirmed:** Classification data stored and logged during collection

### **HIGH PRIORITY - Fix Soon**

#### **BUG #4: Rush Hour Collection Failures** 📉
**Status:** HIGH - Affects key commuting periods  
**Issue:** Higher failure rates during rush hours when data is most valuable

**Pattern:** Morning Rush (07:00-09:00) and Afternoon Rush (15:00-18:00) show more missing data  
**Impact:** Incomplete data during most important analysis periods  
**Fix Required:** Increase retry attempts and collection frequency during peak hours

#### **BUG #4: Direction-Specific Data Quality Issues** 🚂
**Status:** HIGH - Inconsistent data quality between routes  
**Issue:** Oslo S→Myrvoll (afternoon commute) has consistently lower success rates (84-93%) vs Myrvoll→Oslo S (88-97%)

**Impact:** Biased analysis favoring morning commute data  
**Fix Required:** Investigate and fix afternoon route collection issues

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY - Investigate**

#### **BUG #5: Missing Data Validation** 🛡️
**Status:** MEDIUM - Data integrity issue  
**Issue:** No validation prevents impossible data combinations from being stored

**Current Problem:** Database accepts records with `actual_departure_time = NULL` and `delay_minutes > 0`  
**Fix Required:** Add data validation before database insertion

#### **BUG #6: Inconsistent Collection Success Rates** 📊
**Status:** MEDIUM - Operational reliability  
**Issue:** Collection success rates vary significantly by date (75%-97%)

**Impact:** Inconsistent historical data quality  
**Fix Required:** Add monitoring and alerting when success rates drop below 90%
